  "text": "I am an entry-level Full Stack Developer who began my career as a Front End Developer with nearly 4 years of experience. Throughout my journey in frontend development, I have been consistently working with React (JavaScript & TypeScript) and Next.js as my primary frameworks for building modern web applications. Now, as a Full Stack Developer, I have also gained proficiency in backend development using Node.js to build more comprehensive and efficient applications. I continue to rely on my skills in User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, using tools such as Figma and Adobe XD to create attractive and responsive interfaces. Additionally, I am experienced in using TailwindCSS and Bootstrap to enhance the visual aspects and overall user experience of the applications I develop."
